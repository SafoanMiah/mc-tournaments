## Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to streamline the process of organizing and participating in Minecraft tournaments. By providing a centralized platform, we aim to enhance the competitive gaming experience for players and organizers alike.

## Technology Stack

| Component  | Technology        |
|------------|-------------------|
| Frontend   | React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS |
| Backend    | Supabase (PostgreSQL) |
| Build Tool | Vite              |
| Database   | Supbase, PostgreSQL |

## Database Management

This project uses Supabase, a powerful open-source alternative to Firebase, to manage tournament data. Supabase provides a PostgreSQL database, which is used to store and retrieve tournament information, player data, and leaderboard standings. This ensures that all data is kept tidy and easily accessible.

### Setting Up Supabase

To set up the Supabase database, execute the following SQL command to create the necessary table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE public.tournaments_private (
  id BIGINT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
  inserted_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT timezone('utc'::TEXT, now()) NOT NULL,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT timezone('utc'::TEXT, now()) NOT NULL,
  tournament_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  ongoing BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  start_time TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  end_time TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  entry_fee INTEGER,
  is_sponsored BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  sponsored_by TEXT,
  prize_pool INTEGER,
  winner TEXT,
  points INTEGER DEFAULT 0
);
```

This table structure is designed to efficiently store and manage tournament data, leveraging SQL's powerful querying capabilities to maintain data integrity and performance.

## Roadmap

- [ ] **Discord Bot Integration**: Develop a Discord bot to interact with the Supabase database, allowing for easier event management and player communication.
- [ ] **Minecraft Plugin**: Create a Minecraft plugin using Java to further integrate the tournament platform with the game, providing in-game notifications and event management tools.
